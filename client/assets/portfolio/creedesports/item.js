  description: 'A logo designed for the eSports team, Creed. The groups alias name, Creed of Wolves, was taken into consideration during the creation of this logo. After finding the free wolf png online, I proceeded to edit the image to give it the shadow and depth feel. Using the wolf as the team mascot and having “Creed eSports” placed underneath. The color decision was to keep a subtle yet appealing look to the overall logo.',
